What do affine mean (in relation to Affine transformations)
Cull, the act of ignoring triangles/faces not facing user

Homogene coordinates = 
	Coordinates where last component represent scaling?

Perspective divide:
	Perspective rendering make sure objects further away appear smaller
	The illussion of distance is obtained by projecting objects on to an image plane
	The object size is smaller the furher away (larger Z, x' = x/z) hereby the term perspective divide

w-divide = This referes to what happen upon multiplying with projection matrix. W is set equal to -z

	Look at the projection matrix produced by glFrustum. (see the GL spec). Note that the last row is (0, 0, -1, 0). The result of applying this matrix to an (x,y,z,1) coordinate is that the W component becomes -z, i.e. (x', y', z', -z).

COP: Center of Projection. Similar to eye? Point with we project objects toward.
Clipping Plane: Rectangle which is the cut-off point for projections. Similar to a screen.

Shading types:
	Flat: We assume the same l, n and v for the entire polygon, i.e. effectively the entire polygon will be the same color
	Gouraud/Smooth: l,n,v is different for each vertex and light is calculated for each vertex. The rasterizer interpolate the light/color for each fragment
	Phong: l,n,v er calculated fo

Bling-Phong (aka modified Phong): Approximation of reflection in Phong, using halfway vector.
		Rather than calculating the exact reflection from normal and light (r*v), we use norm(l+v)

Drawing-Order of triangles
	Use RH (rightHand rule)
	Notice that enabling CULL will skip triangles which have a negative normal vector

Light-Directional vs PointLight
	The difference is shown in the w-component
	Point Light 		[ x y z 1]
	Directional Light 	[ x y z 0]

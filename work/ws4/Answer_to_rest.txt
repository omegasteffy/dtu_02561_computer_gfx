Part6)
a) What is the difference between Phong shading and Phong lighting (the
Phong reflection model)?

b) What is the difference between flat shading, Gouraud shading, and Phong
shading? List pros and cons of each.
Flat shading:
  Polygon: 1x vertex calculation of light/color is performed and used for all vertexes of the polygon
  Vertex: Just forward the 1x light calculation
  Frag: Use the vertex color directly

Gouraud Shading:
  Vertex: Calculate the 


c) What is the difference between a directional light and a point light?
Directional light is similar to a plane wave, direction is the same across the surface it illuminates
Point light change its light across the surface, unless it is far away

d) Does the eye position influence the shading of an object in any way?
The highlights change depending upon eye-position

e) What is the effect of setting the specular term to (0, 0, 0)?
There is no highlight

f) What is the effect of increasing the shininess exponent (????)?
When shinyness is small the highlights are "broad"
When shinyness is large there is only a small spot representing the highlight.


g) In what coordinate space did you compute the lighting?
It must be transformed

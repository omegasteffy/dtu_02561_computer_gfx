	<div> I found a nice shark at <a href="https://www.yobi3d.com/v/Nwy64Keh0L/Shark.blend">this url</a><br>
	Find it by searching for '5c8luw1p0dz4-Shark_White_Shark.zip'<br>
	I also found out that not all obj-files are compatible. One of the shark models i found loaded a lot triangles+incidecies, but only showed the eyes of the shark.

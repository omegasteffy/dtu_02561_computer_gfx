title: Worksheet 8 - Part 3
q: Compare projection shadows to shadow mapping by listing advantages and disadvantages of the two techniques

 -= ShadowProjection =-
+ Provide an efficient/cheap way of simulating shadows
+ Looks good when performed with alpha blending
% Not easy to apply to other surfaces than a plane
% Must be performed for all object in the scene
% Do not include self-shadowing
% It is hard to find proper documentation the transformation perform the projection (only found the explanation in Angels book and although the overall idea is clear, the implementation matrix is not explaned)

-= Shadow Mapping =-
+ Conceptually easy to understand (current depth, must match the pre-rendered image)
+ Include self-shadowing
+ General purpose
% Requires additional rendering + buffer sampling
% Difficult to make look good at edges (requires higher precision)
% Artifacts can arise if the inner part of a surfaces is lid by light
% The Field of view for the light source must be considered ( i noticed some shadows on my surface because my light source was moving/look a bit different than desired)
